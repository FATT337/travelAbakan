The construction of the stele, which was unveiled in 1980, was supervised by Larisa Oreshkova, the third secretary of the city committee of the CPSU.
In honor of the party official, who did a lot for the city, the citizens of Abakan gave the bronze sculpture the affectionate name of Lora.</p></h1>

The Children's Park "Eaglet" was founded in 1932.
On its territory in the old days was a lake of reeds, its name - "Igir obaa kul," and the literal translation of the Khakass language: "Crooked Lake of stone sculptures.
A small river flowed into the lake and the place gradually turned into a swamp.
Subsequently, the lake was drained and it was decided to plant a garden in its place. The first name of the park was "Gorsad".
In 1960, based on the city garden (Gorsad) was reorganized into the City Park of Culture and Leisure named after Lenin (timed to the 90th anniversary of Lenin) At the same time the existing street October was renamed Lenin Avenue.

				<h1><p id="8" align="center">Topiary Art Park "Dream Gardens"</p>
                <p class="текст1" align="center">The "Gardens of Dreams" complex is a park that made a revolution in landscape culture.
This amazing park, which has no analogues in Russia, is rightfully considered a gem among the attractions of Abakan.
The main advantage of this park is a unique atmosphere, which can be felt only by touching it.
Lines, shapes, colors, created from a huge variety of plants and elements awaken a rush of positive emotions.
The space created in this place has a special effect on visitors: enthusiasm, joy and peace are felt by almost all visitors of this park.
The organizer and inspirer of the project to create a wonderful beauty corner in Abakan - Vasily Adamovich Antropov.
He invented a unique technology to give plants fantastic shapes. Figured tree trimming is a popular trend in landscape design.
The park's territory consists of 12 gardens of different styles harmonically connected with each other. Rabbits, geese and goats live in the original aviaries. Carp and koi swim in the ponds. The territory has a large variety of plants, including red-listed plants.
The park is equipped with recreation areas, an original fountain, a sundial, arbors and swings. It is so pleasant to rest on the mowed lawn.
Another highlight of the park is a smaller copy of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It appeared in Abakan in 2004.
That's how landscape designer Vasily Antropov decided to congratulate his daughter on winning the competition "Miss Belarus 2004". Abakan's Eiffel Tower is about 14 meters tall and has the height of a five-story building.
It took almost a year to build it from thin, handmade slats painted white. About a hundred light bulbs are built into the structure. In the summer it turns into a huge flowerbed, between the levels of which there are flowers in the form of the French flag. It is now the most romantic date spot in town.</p>

				<h1><p id="11" align="center">Monument of Military Glory</p>
				<p class="текст1" align="center">Monument to soldiers who died in the Great Patriotic War. Opened in 1975 to the 30th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.
The ensemble is more than 100 meters long and about 40 meters wide. The total height of the monument is about 12 meters.
The composition of the ensemble consists of three parts. The first part - the mound: the symbol of the ancient Khakass land. The second part - the eternal flame, bursting out of the bowl in the shape of a five-pointed star. On its pedestal there is a circular inscription: "Immortal is your feat, immortal is the memory of you. Behind the eternal flame stands a sculptural composition that consists of two figures - a Russian and a Khakass warrior. By that the authors wanted to express the idea of the joint struggle of the Soviet people against fascism.
The heroes of the composition have prototypes - real people, front-line soldiers and heroes. The prototype of the Russian soldier was a poet, a junior lieutenant Georgy Kuzmich SUVOROV. He wrote poems, plays, collected local folklore. Since the end of 1941 he defended Leningrad. He was wounded, evacuated to Siberia, but in 1942 he returned to the front. His talent as a poet and prose writer manifested itself during his work as a journalist in the division newspaper "For the Motherland" in 1943. For seven months he published on pages of "divisional" tens verses and sketches. In the same year appears some selection of poems of G. Suvorov in magazines "The Star" and "Leningrad". Suvorov was killed on February 13, 1944 at the crossing of Narova. He was twenty-five. He was a platoon commander, a Guardsman. He was posthumously accepted as a member of the Union of Writers.
The prototype of the Khakass warrior was the Hero of the Soviet Union Mikhail Ivanovich CHEBODAYEV. At the beginning of the war the 19-year-old Misha Chebodaev became a soldier of the 955th regiment of the 309th Infantry Division formed in Khakassia in December 1941. He was a scout and a liaison officer, in the first battles he had already shown himself to be a brave soldier. On February, 25, 1945 M. I. Chebodaev was mortally wounded. For the heroism in the crossing of the Dnieper, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and was awarded the Order of Lenin and the medal "Gold Star" posthumously. 
On the right side of the monument is located the Alley of Heroes, where there are ten memorial steles with the fifteen names of Full Cavaliers of the Order of Glory and the thirty-two names of Heroes of the Soviet Union of Khakassia. The continuation of the Alley of Heroes of the Soviet Union is also the Alley of Heroes of Socialist Labor. Seventy-four people in Khakassia have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Their names are embossed on 18 granite steles. 
In the center of the alley - a copper cube with bas-reliefs on which four sides are depicted toilers of industry and agriculture, which in the rear forged the Victory: manufacturing weapons, harvesting bread. All for the front, for the Victory! Residents of Abakan and its guests gather annually on May 9 on Victory Day at the eternal flame, lay flowers and wreaths, remember fallen countrymen.</p>

				<p class="текст" align="center">The sculpture of an ancient warrior is the first thing that greets guests of the new memorial complex on Mount Samohval. This bronze statue weighs more than a ton. Samokhval Mountain has a sacred meaning for the Khakasses - there is a burial ground here. The statue of this warrior is a symbol of the ancient dead. Therefore, and the foot of the statue is made in the form of stones. "Warriors would go off to war, and each one would bring a stone and stack it. In Khakasian obo. When they came back, they would take it back. The remaining stones symbolize the warriors who died for their homeland."
Modern soldiers are symbolized by a statue of a Great Patriotic War fighter - a sculpture in the central part of the memorial. His appearance, however, is not quite typical for the image of a Soviet soldier. It is more reminiscent of the Roman warrior - the winner, the author of the sculpture explains why. "To make our monument different from monuments in our country, I decided to make it in this particular style. Because, to make a warrior as it was in the Great Patriotic War, reeks of socialism. That's why I made it in the style of classical sculpture.
The history of antiquity and the Great Patriotic War on the memorial is connected with an alley of 13 granite stones. Each symbolizes a district and a city of Khakassia. Here on the tiles is a number - the number of soldiers who died in the Great Patriotic War. From Khakassia more than 23 thousand soldiers did not come from the war. Thanks to them we are now alive, healthy and happy in our land.</p></h1>
